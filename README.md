## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### PDF Processing Limitations

Currently, there are some limitations and issues with PDF processing:

1. **Worker Loading Issues**
   - The PDF.js worker sometimes fails to load properly
   - This is due to CORS restrictions and worker file accessibility
   - We're working on a more robust solution for worker file distribution

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Some PDF processing errors may not show detailed error messages
   - We've implemented better error logging and user feedback
   - Future updates will include more comprehensive error handling

### Workarounds

If you experience issues with PDF uploads:
1. Try using smaller PDF files (under 5MB)
2. Convert PDFs to text format if possible
3. Use alternative file formats (TXT, MD, JSON) for reliable processing
